booting process:-
=============
step1: post :- when ever power on self test 
            The cpu bring up BIOS , Basic input output system
       based on the boot priorty the bios simple loads and execute MBR
step2:-  MBR stands for Master boot record it is located first sector of HDD with 512 bytes size. In the 512 bytes size ,446 byte boot loader(IPL) , 64 bytes for partion table information(PTI), 2 bytes for mbr validation check
              MBR doesn't have filesystem knowledge so MBR simple loads and execute GRUB2

step3:- Grand unified boot loader 2. it is responsible to execute kernel image and  initramfs image
              grub file location under /boot/grup2/grub.conf  ==> link file also under /etc/grub2.conf
##              	onemore file /etc/default/grup 
##	systemctl get-default
##       	 ls -l /etc/systemd/system/default.target
##	who -r
##	runlevel
##	systemctl set-default multi-user.target
             
step4:-  kernel loads the necessary driver modules from initrd image
             The kernel starts the systemd process with a process ID of 1 (PID 1).

step5: systemd reads the file /etc/systemd/system/default.target  file . we have total 7 runlevel targets
Run Level	Target Units			Description
0	runlevel0.target, poweroff.target	Shut down and power off
1	runlevel1.target, rescue.target		Set up a rescue shell
2,3,4	runlevel[234].target, multi- user.target	Set up a nongraphical multi-user shell
5	runlevel5.target, graphical.target	Set up a graphical multi-user shell
6	runlevel6.target, reboot.target		Shut down and reboot the system

systemd brings the system to the state defined by the system target
