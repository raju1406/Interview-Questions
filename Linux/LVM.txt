Step1 :- 

 Suppose we have a LVM partition(/home) and running out of space and want to extend or increase file system size.
 So to increase the size of the file system first we must see whether in volume group has free space or not by #vgdisplay vg_name.

step2:-

 If the Volume group has free space then we can increase by using #lvextend  -L +Size LV_Name
after that we must execute the #xfs_growfs Lv_name for updating the increased partition size.


step3:-  
we need to check the is there any free physical volumes.if pv available by using #vgextend vg_name pv_name command 
  we can add the physicalVolume into Volume group . after that we need to increase the Logical volume by using 
  #lvextend  -L +Size LV_Name
after that we must execute the #xfs_growfs Lv_name for updating the increased partition size.

step4:-
