1) Boot process in 6$7? Major differences in both(init.d & system.d)?

==> Fast boot. RHEL7 boots faster than its predecessors. This is achieved by simultaneously starting services that are not dependent on each other.
 In older versions, services used to start one after another. So if one service stuck or delays to start it subsequently delays the following process and boot time.
 This hurdle is removed in RHEL7 allowing it to boot much faster.

==> A new way to manage services on RHEL7 is systemctl. Older service and chkconfig command is being replaced with systemctl.
==> Run levels being called as targets. In RHEL7 run levels are called targets. Default target (run-level) is defined in /etc/systemd/system/default.target. 
==> Former firewall iptables now replaces by firewalld (Firewall Dynamic). iptables still exist in the system and you can disable firewalld and use iptables.

2) RHEL 6 & 7 file system type, and differences in both. Max file system size in both?

==> The default file system is XFS. RHEL6 was launched with EXT4 as the default file system. XFS is a highly scalable, high-performance file system. 
==> XFS supports metadata journaling, which helps in quicker crash recovery. This means file system checks will take very little time. 
==> The XFS file system can be defragmented and extended while mounted. 
==> This makes it more admin friendly in a production environment since it avoids downtime of file systems for activities. Supports only 64 bit systems.
==> Max Supported (Individual) File & Filesystem Size	XFS= 500TB & XFS= 500TB	EXT4= 16TB & EXT4= 16TB

3) nic bonding configuration field, location of the configuration file? What are fieldls are presets in configuration file?

     rhel6:  we need to create a configure file under /etc/modprobe.d/ like bonding.conf 
       in configuration file we need enter the "alias bond0 bonding "
          To check the bonding options  :  cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
          To check the bonding names    : cat /sys/class/net/bonding_master
          To see which bonding option applied :  cat /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/mode
    Please refer how to create a bonding in rhel 6  https://www.unixarena.com/2013/06/how-to-configure-bondingteaming-on.html/

==================================================================================================================================

4) If a nic card id down then what are the steps for brining up another nic card?
  ==>     we have to configure bonding 
  

5) If we replaced a  nic card then what will 

 ==> we have to assign a ip address ,gateway,netmask under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens190(nic card name)
==> After that we need restart the service  by using #systemctl restart network  or #service network restart

6) how to calcutate load avarage based on CPU Cores?
     

=======================================================================
7) Uid/Gid if chganged then what will happen?

    If you change group/user id you must also find and change owners of files. It should not be hard, if users had write access only to their home directories. 
Some services can also be affected, for example nfs, if you use ids.

=====================================================================
8) Sar report genaration? location the file? how to check the logs?

==> To get historic memory utilization details.
            #sar -r -f /var/log/sa/sa01
==> Usually, sysstat, which provides a sar command, keeps logs in /var/log/sysstat/ or /var/log/sa/ with filenames such as /var/log/sysstat/sadd 
where dd is a numeric value for the day of the month (starting at 01). By default, the file from the current day is used; 
however, you can change the file that is used with the -f command line switch. Thus for the 3rd of the month you would do something like:

            # sar -f /var/log/sysstat/sa03
==>  If you want to restrict the time range, you can use the -s and -e parameters.
==>  If you want to routinely get yesterday's file and can never remember the date and have GNU date you could try

            # sar -f /var/log/sysstat/sa$(date +%d -d yesterday)
======================================================================
9) TCP/UDP Protocals? whitch one is fast?

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. 
A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, 
UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.

10) Raid level configuration, and Diffent types of ride levels? How may disk are used for diffent raid levesl?

11) Run level conguration field location and diffenet run levels?
=============================================================================
12) Hardlink and Softlink creation, Diffeneces?

Hardlink : A hard Link
can’t cross the file system boundaries,
can’t link directories,
has the same inodes number and permissions of original file,
permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,
has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.
# ln source.file hardlink.file

soft link:
can cross the file system,
allows you to link between directories,
has different inodes number and file permissions than original file,
permissions will not be updated,
has only the path of the original file, not the contents.

# ln -s source.file softlink.file

13) SSH, TELNET port numbers?
ans:22 ssh, Telnet 23

15) How to check open ports status? weather port in use or not?
netstat -ntlp
====================================================================
16 )What is a process, demon process?

A program like Iguana can be run in different modes depending on the operating system. 
These modes are known as Processes, Daemons, and Services.
=====================================================================================================================================
17) front end and back end process in linux?
===========================================================================================================
18) What is a zombi process, how to identify and kill?

Zombie processes in Linux are sometimes also referred to as defunct or dead processes. 
They’re processes that have completed their execution, but their entries are not removed from the process table.

kill -9 <pid>
==================================================================================================
19) Kernal patching process, kernal vertions on 6 & 7?

20) Perfomance related issues(Memory and cpu related issues)?

21) How to clear cpu alerts, if it reaches 100% utilization then what we have to do?

22) If a server is pinging/up a particular user unable to login then what is the procces to identify the issue, and what are the steps for resolving the issue?

23) If a server boots with diffent ip thent what we have to do for resolving the issue?

24) If a mount point if full then how to increas the mount point size if it is present in LVM, If not then what is the process?

25) how to increase and decrease the mount point size in LVM?

26) What is the NAS and SAN mount points? differences?

27) NFS mount process?
