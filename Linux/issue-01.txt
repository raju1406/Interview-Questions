On one of my Linux Server, Oracle database was not running because of tmpfs . Oracle Team wants to extend the tmfs file system size from 2 GB to 4GB.

Solution: tmpfs is a RAM based temporary file system which is generally mounted on /dev/shm. To   extend the tmfs file system 
=======
Step:1 Check tmfs file system size.
	# df -h /dev/shm/
	Filesystem Size   Used   Avail   Use%  Mounted on
	tmpfs         2.0G 148K   2.0G   1%       /dev/shm

Step:2 Edit the /etc/fstab file.
	#vi /etc/fstab
	          tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs size=4g 0 0
	:wq

Step:3 remount the file system using mount command

	# mount -o remount tmpfs

Step:4 after check the tmfs file system

	# df -h /dev/shm/
 	Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 	tmpfs       4.0G 148K 4.0G  1% /dev/shm
