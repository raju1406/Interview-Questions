  ### What is devops ?
  + Devops bridges the department silos by bringing Developement and Operations together.
  + Devops is implemented by different customers in different ways.
  + In some cases, Devops engineer works within the Scrum team to help them on quick releases.
  + In some cases, Scrum teams can directly release to production using automated capability.
+ Devops works aroudn build and release management only - Continuous Intergration/Testing/Delivery(CI and CD). Customers mainly talk about the tooling and automation required to improve the flow within the build and release.
+ Devops works from Build and Release Management to Production Support - CI and CD , Smart monitoring , Bots assisted Troubleshooting . Customers talk about logging data analytics,self-healing and so on to keep the production up and running.
+ **Devops it a hot skill:** Normally , Scrum teams need to raise a request with IT operations to get an environment for testing and wait for days/weeks. But , in orgainizations that apply Devops practices,it is possible for the teams to get the required enviroment in minutes.

### Daily activity from morning to evening 
+ **9AM:** 
+ I start the day be reviewing what I did yesterday and my plan for today. We do that by looking at our **Sprint Backlog** in our **DevPlus**.
+ I also look at our test environment to see if latest full functional test run is fine or I have failures to fix. Now , I know my day's plan . I update the **Kanban Board** to show latest status.
+  **10AM:**
+  I meet my team for Daily Scrum in front of our **Kanban Board** . I update the team about my plan and any issues I face. I also hear from others . We ensure that overall progress looks fine to meet the sprint Goal.
+  **12PM:**
+  I continue my work . I keep the Kanban Board updated. Scrum Master walks-in and looks at the board to see if there are impediments. We have a brief chat on a help that I needed about an external request.
+  **2PM:** 
+  I check-in my code in GIT , Jenkins server automatically integrates, Complies,and runs static code analysis and integration tests on my code. In the end, check in is rejected. I pair with collegue to fix the code quality issue and successfully check in now.
+  **6PM:**
+  The tool **Ansible** automatically picks up new build and deploys in user test enviroment for business user to test. Wow! That didn't require me to send an email to ops engingeer!
+  I update Kanban Board and leave for the day.
